Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) is the process hospitals and healthcare providers use to manage the financial lifecycle of a patient encounter — from the time an appointment is scheduled until the provider receives full payment for the services rendered.

RCM begins when **patient and insurance details are collected** prior to or during a visit. This step determines the financial responsibility split between the insurance provider and the patient. For example, a total medical charge of $20,000 may be partially covered by insurance ($15,000) while the remaining balance ($5,000) is the patient’s responsibility.

Once **services are provided, the hospital generates medical bills and submits insurance claims**.
These **claims are reviewed by insurance companies, which may approve the claim fully, partially, or deny it altogether**.
Based on the insurer’s response, payments are received and **any remaining balances are followed up with the patient**.

**RCM also involves continuous monitoring and improvement** to ensure timely payments, reduce claim denials, and maintain the financial health of the healthcare provider while continuing to deliver quality patient care.
